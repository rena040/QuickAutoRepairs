Background

Quick Auto Repairs is a privately owned automotive servicing company based in Montego Bay, Jamaica. The company primarily services and repairs vehicles from the following brands: Honda, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, and BMW. Quick Auto specializes in routine maintenance, quarterly servicing, regular repairs, alignment, and balancing. The company employs a team of certified mechanics who handle vehicle diagnostics, repairs, and consultations. As it stands, the company has difficulties with having an efficient and smooth running of their day-to-day activities due to their reliance on manual processes.

Quick Auto Repairs operates an on-site storage facility that houses parts necessary for repairs, along with the tools that are utilized by each mechanic. Its inventory is managed based on the parts acquired and used for vehicle repairs.

Despite their expertise, Quick Auto Repairs faces significant challenges in its day-to-day operations due to its reliance on manual processes. Currently, when it comes to scheduling an appointment although all information is manually stored in a database, there are no measures in place to prevent any clashes with times and Mechanics. Often there are issues with customers when they come to their appointment and realize that they have been double booked as a result this increases their wait time. 

Additionally, inventory management is another area of concern. The tracking process is not very accurate or efficient and it is a difficult task for mechanics to find and update the inventory logs during a busy work day. Overall, the company has various hiccups that happen on a day-to-day basis since there are no consistent ways of doing things. These operational inefficiencies lead to the frequent loss of information which makes it difficult for both the staff and management to carry out their responsibilities. 


Proposed Solution
To address the operational inefficiencies that Quick Auto Repairs are currently facing they have proposed a system that will streamline and modernize their daily activities which will make their processes more efficient.

Customers will be able to create accounts using their name and phone number. Through the use of these personal accounts, customers can book their appointments at their convenience. This booking system will help to reduce overbooking and scheduling conflicts while also allowing the customers to select their mechanic of choice. Additionally, when an account is created, each customer will have a unique loyalty card number so that they may earn points that enable them to earn points that can be redeemed for discounts on future services.

For each vehicle incoming for repair, a mechanic performs a vehicle diagnosis which states the required parts and services necessary. Each mechanic will have access to a dashboard that allows them to view their scheduled appointments and assigned jobs through the company’s online system. The mechanics will have the ability to directly manage inventory by recording the parts that were used which will update the inventory accordingly. 

The system will calculate the total cost of the appointment by combining service charges as well as any applicable loyalty discounts. Additionally, the system calculates mechanics’ pay based on their base hours and will vary based on the specialty of the mechanic.
